Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go

I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter

And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em

Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?

Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night

I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need

I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit (He a fool)
Told her don't let her friends know (Don't)
In the 'Ville and I move like a don (Don)
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (Can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" (It does)
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn (Goddamn)
Spending money at the club like Sam's (Cha-ching)

But she don't put this on the 'Gram (Nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (Ayy)
I can't switch on the fam (Bitch)
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (Hit that shit)
This where my head is (Listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

[Chorus]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed

And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless

Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless

Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Whenever you want it, baby

I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

I heard you got as far as Santa Fe

Usually I would never, would never even care

Lyrics[Intro]
Damn it, Franchise, you did it again
Iceberg want a bag, bitch (Ugh, look)

[Verse 1]
Laugh now, cry later, do yourself a favor
I'm in the Lamborghini slidin, this ain't nothin' major
Every day, straight faded, I don't do chasin'
They just raided my house, they some fuckin' haters
Mama on the phone, like, ""Gotta be safe""
Granny on three-way, granny sayin' prayers
Kissin' on my lil' babies, gotta see 'em later
The devil ain't a lie, he a fuckin' hater
Ayy, baby got her heart broken, need labor
He cheated, like head, so the nigga played her
Now she anti-dick, she a dick hater
Got her in her house playin' with the vibrator
Now you gotta kick, push, gotta turn skater
But he ain't mean to break her heart, he just a heartbreaker
Feelin' like I'm always goin' through the storm
I got beef with Mother Nature

[Chorus]
Gon' have a little fun, gon' do it major
Gon' pour a double shot, be a shot taker
Gon' live a little bit before life take ya
Laugh now, cry later, do yourself a favor

Ice out, make the athletes wanna date her
Fuck, about to cop a condo and the skyscraper
I'm tryna live right now, you tryna live later
They call PETA, cause my shoe got alligator
Said, ""I'm a life-taker,"" really, I'm a life-changer
My family need me, nigga, I'm a lifesaver
Count hunnids on the counter, that's a time table
It's a cold world we live in, man, this shit glacier
Man-made, Lords break 'em, they'll violate ya
Think it-think it's just sweet like some Now 'N Laters
In a snap, like Fabo, your life be gone now or later
That's why I live my life, I'm a demonstrator
You see me livin' life, be a imitator
I be wearin' all this gold, tryna be a Laker
Everyday ballin' out, gotta keep it player

[Chorus]
Gon' have a little fun, gon' do it major
Gon' pour a double shot, be a shot taker
Gon' live a little bit before life take ya

I'ma live it up, that's pronto
Right now, fuck tomorrow
Ride 'til the wheels fall off
Fall off my Forgiato
Toot it up from the backpack-pack-pack
She just wanna get fucked, baby, I know
Let's get drunk, we only live once
Put you in handcuffs like 5-0

New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming

[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe

I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger

Can't be fucked with
Ayy, 4 Pockets, huh
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg]
'Fore I go broke like Joc
Fuck with that dog like Vick (Roof)
Not that rock, that pit'
Palm Angels down to my sock
Can't hold my Glock, reason I don't really like that shit (Nigga, I don't)
Young turnt nigga, can't wife no bitch (At all)
Excuse my French, don't like no bitch (Nope)
Limo tinted, all five of my cars, yeah, I had it hard
Seen my bitch broke bad, I ain't had a heart
Skrrt, yeah, that's us
Two-tone AP, yeah, I'm bust
Got the head from her, I ain't even wanna fuck (Fuck her)
Why? Slut, bye (Fuck on)
Nothin' on me from Saks, everything Revive
Old nigga tellin' on bro, should've died
No, he ain't kill 'em, dawg, he ain't even try
Still'll bet my last shootin' dice in the hood
Take who chain? Nah bitch, not Dugg's
Probably in somethin' fast with a Glock in the hood
Courtside tickets, spillin' Wock' on the wood

First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lams
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (Same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
Bro, I kept taking L's, finally got me a M
Still making double, I don't count what I spend

Gotta come twenty if you hoppin' in the Benz

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn it up a lil' more this time
Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like The Varsity, what'll you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise

Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand

Oh, I'm
Knocking down these buildings
Like I'm breaking through these feelings
Stepping on the dreams in my head
And I'm feeling kinda angry
But my attitude will vary
All the things you think I might've said
Then when you think I'm coming home
Lock the door, leave me alone
Run into the ocean instead

[Refrain]
And I think I'll try and give you up
Running pretty low on luck
Covered in the sheets of my bed
Covered in the sheets of my bed

[Breakdown]

[Verse 2]
So I'm running through this ocean
Failing in its motion
All the love I had for you is dead
There's a fire for your fury
And a gavel for your jury
And a place that you can claim in my stead
So I'm running through this town in black
Leather jeans and stupid hats
""To be or not to be?"" 's what he said

And I think I'll try and give you up
Running pretty low on luck

And I'll do the best that I can
To fuck up all your plans
You're as blind as the eyes that you steal
I hope your wounds will never heal
And I hate every breath that you take
'Cause I feel and I kneel and I break
And I know, oh, I know what it costs
'Cause now I am always lost

And your gaze will hold me in

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it
[Chorus]

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
You might also like[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life

You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'
She on that '42 straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah

In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, ""Stop breathin'""
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah

I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret (Regret)
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night

It sold out some little town I've never been before

Ooh

[Verse 1]
Yeah,  I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

[Post-Chorus]

Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

[Verse 1]
Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em

Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

[Chorus]
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Verse 2]
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
See Morgan Wallen LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like[Chorus]
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

[Bridge]
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook

Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots

[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you

[Verse 2]
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth

Huh? (What?)
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' (Ah)
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' (Ain't sayin' nothin')

Huh? (What she say?)
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' (Ah)
How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen (Just listen)
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business (Go)

[Verse 1]
Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
You know that's a stupid decision (Yup)
Headfirst with it
I shot a shot at my nigga bitch, really didn't think before I did it (No)
Make it make sense (Please)
Luckily, I was on point with the last ho, kept my receipts (Why?)
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets (Go)
Forever I rep, put the set on the chain
I'm thuggin', you already know how I came (Know how)
Yeah, he got money, but niggas be lame
I Lambo'd her life, told her, ""Get out that Range""
Her mani and pedi same color my teeth (White)
She got a blue check and a check without me (Nice)
Hood nigga ridin' in a foreign on E (Still)
Sick of these niggas, COVID-19 (Ugh)
Karate'd the Wocky, tryna kick the cup  (Shake it)
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks (Made it)
Got four different choppers, right there in this truck (Now)
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched (Brr)
Put you in the blender, I could get you slushed (Haha)
I see the comments but really unbothered
I know it's hurtin', she salty, I scarred her
Beware what you lay up and say to these bitches, they can't hold water (Period)

Probably, I don't put that past him (Maybe so)
I thought a ho that be speakin' on me
But be fuckin' a broke nigga said somethin' (Listen)
Hol' up, lil' bitch, get a nigga that's lit

'Posed to be smell-proof, bussin' out the vacuum seal
These niggas lil' boys, childish, Fisher Price
Confident, I'm not cocky, so get it right
She bendin' over, but I want some head first
I don't even wanna know what the pussy like
Trippin' too close to fallin', so I'm ballin'
It's crazy, my opp got shot but I ain't call it (Sike, slow up)

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

(Ah)

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night

Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (Shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip)
I look too good (Look too good)
To be alone (Woo, woo)
My house clean (House clean), my pool warm (Pool warm)
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long

I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb, uh (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool, but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit

I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Ooh

[Verse 1]
Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

[Chorus]
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
(Oh-ooh) No
(Ooh) No, no, no

Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me but that'll last for never

(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

[Verse 1]
Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""

You broke me first

[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're callin' me now
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Verse 2]
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

[Verse 1]
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Verse 2]
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats

And then I hope she cheats

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back

I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know

Laugh now, cry later, do yourself a favor
I'm in the Lamborghini slidin, this ain't nothin' major
Every day, straight faded, I don't do chasin'
They just raided my house, they some fuckin' haters
Mama on the phone, like, ""Gotta be safe""
Granny on three-way, granny sayin' prayers
Kissin' on my lil' babies, gotta see 'em later
The devil ain't a lie, he a fuckin' hater
Ayy, baby got her heart broken, need labor
He cheated, like head, so the nigga played her
Now she anti-dick, she a dick hater
Got her in her house playin' with the vibrator
Now you gotta kick, push, gotta turn skater
But he ain't mean to break her heart, he just a heartbreaker
Feelin' like I'm always goin' through the storm
I got beef with Mother Nature

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile

Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me

Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text

I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened

To a better place than the one we're at

We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

[Pre-Chorus]

He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

[Verse 2]
You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in

Here's to all the late-night drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us

[Chorus]
There's a couple billion people in the world
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause еvery high and every low lеd to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Hey look what a hello from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em 'cause you know me better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else

[Chorus]
There's a couple billion people in the world (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Put your lovin' hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

[Verse 1]
Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

[Verse 2]
So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me, no
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I plant and seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

[Verse 4]
An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

[Verse 5]
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'
[Chorus]
Mmm, yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

[Bridge]
I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

[Chorus]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

And it's motherfuckin' scary

I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)

We real life made for each other (Woo)

When other chickens tryna get in my coop

A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows

(And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it)

[Verse 1]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Post me a pic, finna make me a profit
When the liquor hit, then a bitch get toxic
(Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’?)
I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, ha-hands on my knees
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)

Hoes said they wish a bitch would, and I'm a genie
Bitch so hot, gotta stay in bikinis
He got a girl, but he keep beggin' to see me
I love it when a nigga got a mouth full of VVs
No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?
I don't give a fuck 'bout a blog tryna bash me
I'm the shit per the Recording Academy (Ah)
[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit

Drinkin' out the motherfuckin' bottle on my thot shit
Everything I eat go straight to my pockets

Goth girl shit, I'm a real hot topic
Fuckin' on a nigga, make him sing, on some pop shit
I need a real headbanger, on some rock shit
Pussy like crack, wanna hit it like dope
Got a real hot box, but a bitch don't smoke (Ah)
Hot girl, but I'm still the coldest, hey
I'm the big homie, but I ain't the oldest, hmm
Bitch dry hatin', tryna get noticed
Man, ain't nobody come to see you, Otis, look
How many bitches lyin' if they say they bars is better?
They really puppets, so I really gotta go and Geppetto
I'm really talkin', but it really can apply to whoever
My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (Huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'
He could never say that I was one of his women
I don't even let niggas know where I stay
I'll be damned if he thinkin' he poppin' up on this pimpin' (Ah)
[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)

I can't fuck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I been all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust, but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside, I'm a high roller
I've been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick-knacks
Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach
I just fucked off a million, but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat
She know I got the game, but I'm never gon' give it back

To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Bridge]
In chess, a king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Watch your mouth 'fore I fly out your bitch (Where?)

Did you cruise down a backroad

Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a hallelujah

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?

Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothin' from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Verse 2]
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Bridge]
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawin', got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Verse 2]
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could

I was no daddy's dream, was not your mama's prayer
But I was your first and your last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire when I smoked my Bronco tires
Out of that town

[Verse 2]
I'm good at rollin' dice, no good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin' life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' reckless, nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

This ain't for everybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you, it's a hell of a view

[Verse 3]
I paint with my old Gibson, you paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby, let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars, chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

You go ahead, let your hair down

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

Out of nowhere

Damn, this motherfucker too crazy, Saucii
Let that shit ride, Eighty8
When the shit over, it's over
I don't know what's after or, you know

[Verse]
I keep my gun in my drawers, ducking the sad news (Oh yeah)
My phone say seven missed calls, I know it's bad news
This life had left me so scarred, I'm knowing that's true
Remember times got so hard, I got it tattoed (So hard)
I ain't did no shows but made some bread (Yeah)
I gotta keep the family fed (Yeah, yeah)
Look, just talked to pops about the feds
I ain't gon' lie, he had me scarеd, uh
I feel 'em coming, nigga (Yeah)
I'll keep on running, nigga (Yeah)
If wе go down bad, keep it a hundred, nigga
My girl all in my ear screaming, ""Spend some time""
I promise I'll be here when I can get some time
Right now, I got to get what's mine (For sure)
I'll be thuggin' 'til the end of time
And fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name
Make sure you write the truest in the motherfucking game
See Rod Wave LiveGet tickets as low as $86You might also like[Chorus]
On my tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me
Finally, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally
I'll get to fly away, somewhere, someday
Fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name (Yeah)
Make sure you write the truest in the game
On my tombstone when they bury me (Yeah)
By the river, they will carry me (Yeah)
Finally, I'll be resting in peace (Oh yeah)
Finally, finally, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(You know what I’m saying, I don’t really know what I’m saying, I don’t know what’s after this shit)
Finally, finally (Everybody think they know but fuck it, I sleep on the floor)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (This shit comes with a lot, it’s a lot of pressure, I’m a young nigga though)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
On my tombstone when they bury me (Believe that man, I’m a hustler)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, on my tombstone when they bury me, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, finally I'll be resting in peace

Talkin’ God. Amen. Lyrics[Verse 1: Chase Rice]
Firewood crackle in the fall air
""Red Dirt"" playing on a radio
Big Dipper hanging high up there
Breathe in the Backwoods and let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Chase Rice]
I ain't ever been the church goin' type
Can't quote much past 3:16
Even though it's a Friday night
Church found me

[Chorus: Chase Rice]
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen

[Post-Chorus: Chase Rice & Tyler Hubbard]
Tell em' boys
Yeah, baby

[Verse 2: Tyler Hubbard, with Brian Kelley]
Gotta thank him for a little piece of dirt
Little peace of mind from a cold one
Got a country angel I don't deserve

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Verse 1]
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)

Be like, ""You'll be okay"" and, ""Everything is alright,"" uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[Verse 1]
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so lеt me spell it out

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

A-B-C-D-E, F you
[Verse 2]
You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all

She can grow right from her womb a family
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see  (Ayy)
You can reciprocate
I got delicious taste, you need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace

I can be your lady, I'm a woman
I'm a motherfucker, but they got a problem
Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, ""We ain't got the common sense""
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (Yeah)
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (Nah)
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top (Top)
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (Why?)

Things haven't been quite the same

When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everything I can to help you through

Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby

Now you're in my life

But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming, too

I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in L.A
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

[Verse 2]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

[Verse 3]
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet
But now she got me smokin' out the window
Mm, mm, mm

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh no)
Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib
Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah)
Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC
Can't believe it (Can't believe it)
I'm in disbelief

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]
This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists
And here I am all alone (All alone)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
You got me out here

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window)
Singin', ""How could she do this to me?""
(How could she do this to me?)
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (Mmm)
But I was wrong
'Cause she belong
To everybody, everybody, ooh

Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight
Screamin', ""Hercules"" (Hercules, Hercules)
Got me in the club lookin' for a new love
Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please)
Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl?
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists
And here I am all alone (All alone)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
You got me out here

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo)
Singin', ""How could she do this to me?"" (How? How could she do this?)
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's for sure, one thing's for sure)
But I was wrong (I was wrong)
'Cause she belong (She belong)
To everybody, everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
(That girl, yes, she belong to everybody) Ooh

[Interlude: Anderson .Paak]
(Oh no)
Look here, baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need
But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets
Look out
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me
Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back)
To the city, oh, you got me

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Smokin' out the window (Ooh)

(Damn, Kai, you goin' crazy)

[Verse 1]
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

(Heads Carolina, tails California)

[Verse 1]
I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

[Chorus]
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'

Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan]
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around

I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you
Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move

Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?

I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

[Verse 1]
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?""
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе

[Pre-Chorus]
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?

Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes

But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is

One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy

She asked me where I's from
I said, ""Somewhere ya never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville""
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my Red Wings on the beach

[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (Huh)
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said, ""Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home""
And she said, ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

I don't want a lot for Christmas

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own (Ooh)

Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Jack makes good whiskey, yeah

Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
And that's all good but for me

Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey
But God makes the good stuff
Woah-oh, oh-oh, God makes the good stuff

[Verse 2]
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes

Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent

Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

[Verse 2]
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the mornin'
When you got home from work

[Verse 2]
Makin' plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
Old love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you

[Chorus]
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

[Verse 3]
Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there

She finna tell me ""No way"" and it's cap
Nigga, can't even see me, I'm way in the sky
G5 the flight, nigga way in the sky
G5 the flight, man, I'm way outta here

[Chorus]
G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on shit, turn it up and I gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of thе sewer
Chrome Hеart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid

[Verse 1]
Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean
You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win
Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition
Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist
I'm never sober, don't think I'ma quit

Count up some millions then take some more drugs
Been stuck in my memory, they wasn't showing love
Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub
I started this wave and ain't using a brush
Stopped taking molly, I'm back on the E
Flying commercial, you ain't high as me
Driving a spaceship, the one with the wings
Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key
Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back
Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack
After I hit your bitch, givin' her back
Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap
Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt

Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her
That was her favorite song
She sang along every time it came on
The first time we danced was to Marina Del Rey
And I fell right there and then
I didn't want that song to end
Baby Blue was the color of her eyes
I can still see them in my mind
Probably will for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I'll get to missin' her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight

[Verse 2]
The other day right out of the Blue Clear Sky
You came on in my truck
I couldn't turn it off fast enough
I tried to get back in the game
But this ole heart just ain't the same

[Verse 1]
You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm

You've forgotten about, oh

Is it 'cause I made maximum profit? (Uh-huh)
Shoppin', cop it, spot it, drop it (Drop that)
Celebrate wins and learn from losses (Uh-huh)
Came from the jungle, now we young bosses
I told her to come roll with a goon (Come roll with a goon)
I took his girl and then gave her back, now I'm off to the moon (Uh-huh)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Russ Millions & G Herbo]
Fill up the ride with burners
Touch one of mine, say nothin', it's curtains (Fill 'em up)
Need a big MAC, no burger
Back then, I was up front like Werner (Bullet)
Talkin' smack, you better stand on that
Gang pull up, crash and leave a paigon flat (Shatta)
Baddest bitch, I got hands on that
She love me bad, but she knows that I'm tied (Bullet)
Pull her hair when I hit from the back (Feet)
Pull it up when you hear this track (Pull)
Gang pullin' up, and we're airing that
I can't call the truce, I'm not hearing that 'cause (Woi)
Friends turned enemies, 'course that's jealousy
Should've took a M when man were tellin' me
None of them boy can fuck with my energy (Ayy, uh, ayy, ayy)
Russ got the game in a pedigree

[Verse 4: G Herbo]
I'm who they call to kill on a track
Swervo, I been had a mill' with no plaques
Everyday toting the steel, but it's black
Live in L.A., but I chill in the 'Raq
Why you drink liquor, no juice, like that? (Me)
Why you just pull up in a coupe like that?
'Cause I make a lot of cake, how you doin'? Like that
You don't do it like this, you gotta do it like that
I be playin' with racks, drum on the neck, got me playin' it back
You don't want smoke, I be playin' with gats (Brr)
Boy, I get so much cash
Only time I get mad, when I'm payin' my tax (Woo)
You don't know how I feel, shit really lit
You don't know how I live
Keep on the ski, you don't know who I is
And beats like these be easy to me 'cause we invented drill

I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist

[Chorus]
I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town

[Verse 2]
So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote
